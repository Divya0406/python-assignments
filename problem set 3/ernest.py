Question: In 1939 Ernest Vincent Wright published a 50,000 word novel called Gadsby that does not contain the letter "e." Since "e" is the most common letter in English, that�s not easy to do. In fact, it is difficult to construct a solitary thought without using that most common symbol. It is slow going at first, but with caution and hours of training you can gradually gain facility. All right, I�ll stop now. Write a function called has_no_e that returns True if the given word doesn�t have the letter "e" in it.'''


str=raw_input("enter the string")
if 'e' not in str and 'E' not in str:
  print "true"
else: 
  print "false"
